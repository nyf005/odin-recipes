    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The kedjenou is an Ivorian recipe, traditionally prepared in a canary
      (earthenware container) and cooked over a wood fire. This chicken kedjenou
      is less traditional but just as delicious!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>1 large onion</li>
      <li>3 large tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 large eggplant</li>
      <li>1 free-range chicken cut into pieces</li>
      <li>2 sprigs of thyme</li>
      <li>3 to 4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 tsp. grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 tsp. chili pepper (Cayenne or Espelette)</li>
      <li>fine salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash, peel and cut the eggplant into pieces. Wash and dice the tomato.
        Peel and slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the garlic clove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken pieces in a pressure cooker, add the eggplant pieces,
        diced tomatoes, onion rings and chopped garlic. Season with salt and
        pepper and season to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves and grated ginger. Mix well (without
        adding water) and close the pressure cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to heat over low heat. The pressure will be felt after about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without opening the pressure cooker, it is now time to "kedjenou"
        (literally "stir in"): stir every 5 minutes for 15 minutes, swirling the
        contents of the cooker for 5 to 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of the cooking time, serve your kedjenou chicken hot,
        accompanied by attiéké (a kind of Ivorian couscous made from cassava),
        white rice or boiled yams.
      </li>
    </ol>
