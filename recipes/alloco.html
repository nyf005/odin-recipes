    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Alloco (Aloco or Alloko) itself is very simply (and somewhat blandly)
      fried plantains. </p>
      <p>Plantains are a staple crop throughout much of Western Africa, but it
      would still be hard to imagine that a recipe of simply fried
      plantains would be as ubiquitous as it is.</p>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>03 sticks of plantains (yellow and brown)</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using a sharp knife, cut off both ends of the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the plantain skin. Slit a shallow line along the long seam of the plantain.</li>
      <li>Cut the plantains into medium-sized diagonal pieces and set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Check to see if the oil is ready by carefully trying a piece of plantain. The oil should bubble before proceeding with the rest. If not, wait another 2 minutes. If the oil is too hot, turn off the gas and wait about 2 minutes before continuing.</li>
      <li>Fry in batches, turning once, until the plantains have reached the desired color (brown) about 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>Then continue cooking, turning the plantains occasionally, until tender and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Carefully remove the plantains with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a plate or tray lined with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and/or cinnamon sugar, if desired. Serve hot. You can eat it with fried chicken, fried fish with a good chilli etc...</li>
    </ol>
